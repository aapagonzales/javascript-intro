#NUMBERS

Defining a number in JS is simple.
The NUMBER data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals.
Entering a number into the console will return it back to you.

<b> Arithmetic Operations </b>
Calculations with numbers are pretty easy as well. Type out an expression the way you would on a Sci-Calculator.
3 + 2.1 -> 5.1
5 + 5 -> 10

Comparing Numbers
You can compare two numbers to see if one's greater than, less than or equal to the other.
5 > 10
Returns: false
5 < 10
Returns: true

Comparisons between numbers will either evaluate to true or false.

The values <i>true</i> and <i>false</i> have significant inmportance in JavaScript.
These values are called <b> Booleans </b> and this is another data type in JavaScript
