#NUMBERS

Defining a number in JS is simple.
The NUMBER data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals.
Entering a number into the console will return it back to you.

Arithmetic Operations
Calculations with numbers are pretty easy as well. Type out an expression the way you would on a Sci-Calculator.
3 + 2.1 -> 5.1
5 + 5 -> 10

Comparing Numbers
You can compare two numbers to see if one's greater than, less than or equal to the other.
5 > 10
Returns: false
5 < 10
Returns: true

Comparisons between numbers will either evaluate to true or false.

The values true and false have significant inmportance in JavaScript.
These values are called Booleans and this is another data type in JavaScript
